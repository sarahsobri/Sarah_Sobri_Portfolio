# Project 1 : Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Under-Extreme-Imbalanced-Data (Project Overview)
##### Due to the small number of cases of one class, the machine learning model struggles to generalise the behaviour of the minority class, resulting in poor predicted accuracy (Japkowicz & Stephen, 1998). This has hampered the ability of numerous models to function to their full capacity in tackling this long-standing issue. As a result, multiple resampling approaches will be used in this project, including random under-sampling, Synthetic Modified Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Modified Synthetic Modified Oversampling Technique (MSMOTE), which we have defined to be the Support Vector Machine Synthetic Modified Oversampling Technique SVMSMOTE. The outcome of these machine learning models have been assessed by their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, which will be used to classify the resampled datasets using classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Upon completeing the analysis, we have found that the best model that outperforms the rest is the random forest with SMOTE with precision of 88% and recall of approximately 85%. Morever, the model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 100%. The project's key contribution will be the development of optimal machine learning algorithms and the most optimal resampling approaches for dealing with class unbalanced difficulties in credit card fraud datasets.
